# Palindrome Checker

A palindrome is a string that reads the same both forward and backward. For example, the string "madam" is a palindrome. Write a program that uses a recursive function to check whether a string is a palindrome. Your program must contain a value-returning function that returns true if the string is a palindrome and false otherwise. Do not use any global variables, use the appropriate parameters.
